Copyright 2018 Manish Parashar

Developed and tested on: NETGEAR R8500 / DD-WRT v3.0-r35550M kongac (03/28/18)

Software requirements: DD-WRT (preferably latest), cURL

Download: https://github.com/m-parashar/adbhostgen/releases/latest

INSTALLATION:
-------------

1a. Download installer.sh and make it executable (chmod +x), then run it in /tmp or /jffs.
    It will automatically create /jffs/dnsmasq and extract required files into it. OR

1b. Download and extract adbhostgen.7z or adbhostgen.tar.gz into /jffs/dnsmasq directory.

2. Run adbhostgen.sh in /jffs/dnsmasq


SETTINGS:
---------

1. Disable internal flash (JFFS2) if you already have a USB drive mounted as /jffs.
   SEE: https://i.imgur.com/bDJBxd8.png

2. Enable DNSMasq and local DNS for LAN and WAN. Add these lines under the additional options section.

	conf-file=/jffs/dnsmasq/mpdomains
	addn-hosts=/jffs/dnsmasq/mphosts

    SEE: https://i.imgur.com/ez7yLM4.png

3. Enter additional options for dnsmasq if required, for example:

	domain-needed
	bogus-priv

4. Under Administration -> Cron, enter this or choose your own schedule:

	0 6 * * 1,4 root /jffs/dnsmasq/adbhostgen.sh

5. Reboot


USAGE:
------

Add your blacklist or whitelist domains to myblacklist and mywhitelist files respectively.
Do not save anything in blacklist or whitelist files as they will be overwritten every
time the script is executed.

CHANGELOG:
----------

20180331:
POINT RELEASE with all the bugfixes and new features from the alpha releases below.

20180329a2:
No more "bad name at line n" errors.

20180328a2:
Changed default ad destination IP from 0.0.0.0 to 0.1.2.3

20180327a1:
New options:
-i <ip-address>
--ip=<ip-address>
where <ip-address> is an IPv4 address of your own personal ad hell.

20180326a1:
New options:
-f, blocks Facebook.com and services
-F, blocks Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp

20180324a6:
Significant changes and bugfixes. The script should behave better as a cron job now.
A new option -q or --quiet suppresses output to stdout/console, yet retains log entires.
Considering that many users are still on ancient DD-WRT versions with outdated and/or
expired cURL certificates and exotic configuration that often doesn't play well with
this script, it now uses insecure cURL downloads (-k) as default mode of operation.
For experienced users, the new --secure command line parameter restores the secure
TLS/SSL communication with servers. After thinking long and hard and working with
users on solving their problems, offering sane defaults with switches to enable
advanced functionality seems like a good tradeoff. For now.

20180315:
Major update. Code cleanup and bugfixes. Update function added.
If there are no stopping bugs, minor updates will be rolled out
directly to Github and users can update to the latest version
by using the -u or --update command line option. Stable point
releases with installer will be rolled out as and when there
are important bugfixes and changes to the codebase.

20180314:
Minor bugfixes. Lists with false positives moved to BLITZ=3 section.
BLITZ=1 is now default, since new users are often uncomfortable with
finding and whitelisting useful harmless services that may be blocked
by the higher protection levels.

The script now logs important system events directly into syslog.

20180313:
Minor bugfixes. Official whitelist formatted and updated.

20180312rev2:
A. added --offline mode, for processing existing lists without re-downloading everything.
B. BLITZ=0 mode is back. Four levels of protection exist now: 0, 1, 2 [default], and 3.
   You can override default aggression level with command line arguments.
C. Added more lists and distributed everything among the four BLITZ levels.

20180312rev1: 
BUGFIX

20180312:
A. New command line options to pause and resume protection.
B. Added more ad/malicious domains in both hosts and dnsmasq format.
C. BLITZ=0 is no longer an option.
   BLITZ=1 is the minimum protection level.
   BLITZ=2 mode now blocks approx 675000 unique ad/mal domains. [DEFAULT]
   BLITZ=3 is likely to result in ~40-50MB hosts file. Exercise caution.
